Started dealing with evaluating P(Xit=Xi|Y=k), but there are just too many iterations in the last three loops, they are not possible to complete in time, I tried dealing it by converting the training data from lists to a dictionary for faster iteration but its still long.

Found the solution. Explained in the file!
